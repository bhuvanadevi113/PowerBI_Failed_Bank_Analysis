## 1.Total Count of Failed Banks
570 banks have failed, as shown prominently on the dashboard
## 2.State-Level Analysis
Georgia (93 failures) - The highest number of failed banks.
## 3.Timing of Failures
### By Month
July (75 failures) has the highest number of failures, followed by September (64) and April (61).
Seasonal patterns or fiscal/quarter-end activities may have influenced the timing.
### By Quarter:
Q3 (154 failures) has the most bank failures, followed by Q2 (142), Q1 (138), and Q4 (136).
This may indicate heightened financial reporting and regulatory activities during Q3.
### By Year:
There’s a peak in failures around 2008–2010, corresponding to the global financial crisis, with a sharp decline afterward.
## 4.Acquisition Patterns
### Top Acquiring Institutions:
Many failed banks (31 instances) were not acquired by another institution.
State Bank and Trust (12 acquisitions) and First-Citizens Bank (11 acquisitions) were the most frequent acquirers of failed banks.
## General Observations
### High Geographic Concentration:
Georgia and Florida alone account for ~30% of total failures, hinting at localized risk factors.
### Crisis Impact
The sharp spike in failures during the 2008–2010 crisis suggests the systemic impact of the financial crisis on smaller banks.
